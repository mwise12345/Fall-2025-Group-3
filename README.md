# Problem Description

Our task is to develop a relationship database to represent the operations of a digital streaming service. The data model will represent operations involving the user and operational side of the company. Information will need to be stored about departments, employees, and on the user side, watch history, favorites, and more. Data related to the content on the streaming platform will be stored as well such as content type and genres. We are to populate the databases and model the relationships to enable the digital streaming service to seamlessly operate its data and scale.
